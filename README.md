## **Project Description**
This is a mobile friendly companion webpage for visitors to the "Galactic-Ping-Pong" art show (Artwork by [Katheryn Cellerini Moore](https://kmoostudios.com)).

This mobile friendly, themed webpage allows users to select which gallery they are currently inside, and provides an interactive gallery map to aid in navigating the space.  These maps are touch-friendly, and allow the user to pan and zoom to get more information about a specific area of the art installation. The icons on the gallery maps represent physical objects in the spaces called "[SDSS Plates](https://voyages.sdss.org/preflight/sdss-plates/)" (Sloan Digital Sky Survey Plates).

SDSS Plates are 31" diameter, 1/8" think aluminum disks, each with 640-1000 small holes drilled into them. Each hole corresponds to a real galaxy, star, or quasar.  The scientists of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey mount these plates into extremely large telescopes, allowing them to make accurate scientific observations about each object (as represented by a plate hole).  The scientist can use this collective data to help map out the universe.

While in the art galleries, a visitor can use this webpage to find the specific SDSS Plate that is in front of them.  When it is selected, a new browser window will open, containing a touch-friendly, interactive representation of the plate.  The visitor can then pan and zoom around the digital version of the plate and select any of the 640-1000 holes (astronomical objects).  When any hole is selected, the visitor is taken to the SDSS website and presented with scientific data specific to that galaxy, star, or quasar.
